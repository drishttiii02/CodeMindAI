**CodeMindAI** 

**Project Description**

**Overview**

CodeMindAI is an innovative AI-powered mental health support system, delivered via a secure and interactive web-based platform. The system integrates multiple advanced technologies—including real-time facial emotion detection, clinical depression screening (PHQ-9 questionnaire), sentiment analysis, and an NLP-driven conversational chatbot—to provide users with holistic emotional well-being assessment and personalized support strategies.

By combining objective signals (facial expressions, sentiment in text) with standardized clinical assessments (PHQ-9) and empathetic AI-driven dialogue, CodeMindAI delivers an accessible, stigma-free, and user-friendly platform for individuals seeking mental health guidance.

**Problem It Solves**

Mental health challenges such as stress, anxiety, and depression are increasingly prevalent worldwide, yet they often remain undetected and untreated due to:
Stigma and hesitation in openly seeking help.
Limited access to professional therapists, especially in rural or underserved areas.
Lack of awareness about personal mental health status until symptoms worsen.
Time and cost barriers in visiting clinics or mental health professionals.
As a result, many individuals continue to struggle in silence, without receiving the support they need.

**CodeMindAI addresses this gap by offering:**

Early detection of emotional distress through AI-driven facial recognition and sentiment analysis.
Accessible self-assessment using clinically validated tools like PHQ-9.
Continuous support through an AI chatbot that encourages emotional expression and provides coping suggestions.
Personalized insights that help users monitor their mental health journey over time.

**Core Features**

Real-time Facial Emotion Detection
Uses advanced computer vision models to detect emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, fear, or neutrality from webcam/video inputs.
Provides immediate feedback about the user’s emotional state.
Clinical Depression Screening (PHQ-9)
Implements the standardized Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) to measure the severity of depression symptoms.
Generates a score and provides actionable recommendations based on severity levels.
Sentiment Analysis
Analyzes user text (journals, chatbot interactions, self-reports) to detect positivity, negativity, or neutrality in their language.
Identifies recurring negative thought patterns and provides insights.
Chatbot
Engages users in empathetic, human-like conversations.
Encourages self-expression, active reflection, and provides coping mechanisms (e.g., breathing exercises, positive affirmations).
Can direct users to professional resources if severe distress is detected.
Personalized Insights Dashboard
Visualizes emotional trends over time using charts and reports.

**Impact**

1.Reduces stigma by enabling private, non-judgmental mental health engagement.
2.Expands access to mental health screening and support across geographic and socio-economic barriers.
3.Encourages self-awareness and proactive emotional management.
4.Bridges the gap between early detection and professional care, potentially reducing the severity of untreated mental health conditions.
